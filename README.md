Sometimes you want to be able to submit quick requests from the command-line, without having to look up curls in your bash history or switch to Postman to locate a request.  This is where Spaceman comes in.

Spaceman provies a series of request commands that you can exceute with a few simple keywords.  Sets of requests are managed via charts, and Spaceman allows you to easily add charts to the codebase to make new request commands available.
